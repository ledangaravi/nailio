    <string name="nailed_it">Wow! You\'ve #NailedIt. Your NAILIO score is great.
        Here are some tips to keep up the good work:</string>

    <string name="verdict_general_tips">
        • Wear rubber gloves when carrying out household cleaning
        \n• Avoid cutting your cuticles
        \n• Trim your nails on a regular basis
        \n• Keep your hands and feet dry
        \n• Make sure you are taking your daily requirements in vitamins and minerals (Vitamin B, Calcium, and Zinc are the best here!)
        \n• Restrain from biting or picking your nails
        \n• Wear clean socks</string>

    <!-- todo 98% -->
    <string name="verdict_other">NAILIO thinks you are about 98% likely to be suffering from a type
        of nail dystrophy. In most cases, this is not something serious to worry about.
        Nail dystrophy is the distortion and discolouration of a normal nail. No fungal infections
        have been recognised. It is likely your nail disfigurement is due to a lack of care and hygiene.</string>
